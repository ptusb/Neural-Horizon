This repository serves as my "Central Intelligence Agency"—a structured collection of technical research, paper summaries, and deep dives into the technologies I master. It tracks the evolution of AI Agentic behavior, MCP expansions, and high-velocity automation.

## 🔬 Research Focus Areas

### 1. Agentic Frameworks (MCP & Beyond)

- Deep dive into **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Building custom bridges for local system control.
- Analysis of **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** and swarm intelligence.

### 2. The Automation Stack (n8n & Logic)

- Research on high-concurrency event loops in Node.js for automation.
- Security best practices for webhook-based enterprise integrations.

### 3. Generative Creative Theory

- Mathematical foundations of Stable Diffusion and Firefly.
- Prompt engineering as a form of "Software Architecture."

## 🎯 Philosophy

In a world moving at the speed of intelligence, a static skill set is a liability. This repo is the proof of my **Learning Velocity**—the most critical metric for a technical leader.
